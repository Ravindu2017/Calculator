# Calculator

This is my attempt at creating a calculator for the odin project course. It works with keyboard buttons as well as clicking. The percision of the numbers is not accurate due to floating point numbers. Styling was not ideal either. The change of sign symbol, modular, and CE buttons' functionality is not yet implemented.
